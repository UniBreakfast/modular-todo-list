#! project://todo.txt

Requirements:
  - Frontend ToDo List app, vanilla JS, no frameworks
  - Form with an input field and a submit button
  - List of items
  - Sumbitting the form should add a new item to the list
  - Items can be deleted by clicking on "delete" button next to them
  - Items can be (un)checked with a checkbox on the left side of the item or by clicking on the item text
  - Form, list, record storage, check mod and remove mod should be implemented as modules with expected API
^
Form module requirements:
  Interfaces:
    Page HTML File is supposed to include:
      - <link rel="import" name="form" href="path/form.htm">
      - <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/form.css">
      - <script src="form/path.js" defer></script>
    ^
    Form module should expect:
      - init(storage) method to be called at the start of the application
    ^
    Governing Script JS File will expect for global variable `form` to have an object with the following methods:
      - init(storage) - render the form into the page body element, save the storage object for later use, and set up event listeners
    ^
    Storage module will expect:
      - storage.add({text}) method to be called from the inside of the Form module eventually when the form is submitted
    ^
    User should be able to (after `init` method is called):
      - see a text input
      - see a submit button with the text "Add"
      - write or paste text into the text input
      - submit the form by clicking the submit button leading to the storage.add({text}) method being called with an object containing the text input value as the only property `text` being passed as an argument
    ^
  Other requirements (preferable):
    - module should be implemented in a separate folder with four files: `form.htm`, `form.css`, `form.js` and `form.html`
    - `form.htm` should contain the form HTML structure without any html structure around it, it can appear on the page only as a result of the form module initialization done with JS
    - `form.css` should contain the styles for the form provided in `form.htm` without any additional styles, ensure that selectors are specific enough to avoid conflicts with styles from other modules
    - `form.js` should contain the form module implementation
    - `form.html` should be a standalone page that allows the user to test the form module in isolation
